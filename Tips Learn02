Another important tip is to learn to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts. 
This is called "structured problem solving" or "decomposition". Rather than trying to solve a problem as a whole, 
try to break it down into smaller steps and focus on solving each step separately. This will make seemingly complex tasks easier to handle, 
and help you develop strong analytical skills, which are essential in the world of programming.
